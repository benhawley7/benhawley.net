# benhawley.net
Personal Website and Porfolio of Work

## Built in Preact
As a learning project, I have reimplemented the website in Preact.

## How do I... ?
### Checkout and install
```bash
git clone git@github.com:benhawley7/benhawley.net.git
cd ben-hawley.net && npm install
```

### Build
```bash
npm run-script build
```

### Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Start the Server with Parcel (Development)
```bash
npm run-script start-parcel
```

## What do now?
- [x] Implement in Preact
- [ ] Comment Stuff
- [ ] Set Up Eslint Config to work properly with Preact
- [ ] Create a better build process (which isn't Parcel)
- [ ] Set Up Server Side Rendering
- [ ] Set Up Offline Mode with Service Worker
- [ ] Implement as PWA
