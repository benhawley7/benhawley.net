## Built in Svelte
As a learning project, I have reimplemented the website in Svelte.

## How do I... ?
### Checkout and install
```bash
git clone git@github.com:benhawley7/benhawley.net.git
cd ben-hawley.net && npm install
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Start the Server for Developer

```

## What do now?
